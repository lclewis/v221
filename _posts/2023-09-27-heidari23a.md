title: Explaining Graph Neural Networks Using Interpretable Local Surrogates
abstract: We propose an interpretable local surrogate (ILS) method for understanding
  the predictions of black-box graph models. Explainability methods are commonly employed
  to gain insights into black-box models and,  given the widespread adoption of GNNs
  in diverse applications, understanding the underlying reasoning behind their decision-making
  processes becomes crucial. Our ILS method approximates the behavior of a black-box
  graph model by fitting a simple surrogate model in the local neighborhood of a given
  input example. Leveraging the interpretability of the surrogate, ILS is able to
  identify the most relevant nodes contributing to a specific prediction. To efficiently
  identify these nodes, we utilize group sparse linear models as local surrogates.
  Through empirical evaluations on explainability benchmarks, our method consistently
  outperforms state-of-the-art graph explainability methods. This demonstrates the
  effectiveness of our approach in providing enhanced interpretability for GNN predictions.
