title: Breaking the Structure of Multilayer Perceptrons with Complex Topologies
abstract: Recent advances in neural network (NN) architectures have demonstrated that
  complex topologies possess the potential to surpass the performance of conventional
  feedforward networks. Nonetheless, previous studies investigating the relationship
  between network topology and model performance have yielded inconsistent results,
  complicating their applicability in contexts beyond those scrutinized. In this study,
  we examine the utility of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for modeling intricate
  relationships among neurons within NNs. We introduce a novel algorithm for the efficient
  training of DAG-based networks and assess their performance relative to multilayer
  perceptrons (MLPs). Through experimentation on synthetic datasets featuring varying
  levels of difficulty and noise, we observe that complex networks founded on pertinent
  graphs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy, particularly within high-difficulty
  scenarios. Additionally, we explore the theoretical underpinnings of these observations
  and explore the potential trade-offs associated with employing complex networks.
  Our research offers valuable insights into the capabilities and constraints of complex
  NN architectures, thus contributing to the ongoing pursuit of designing more potent
  and efficient deep learning models.
