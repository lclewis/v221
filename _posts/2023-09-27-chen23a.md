title: 'The Weisfeiler-Lehman Distance: Reinterpretation and Connection with GNNs'
abstract: In this paper, we present a novel interpretation of the Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (WL) distance introduced by \cite{chen2022weisfeilerlehman} using concepts from
  stochastic processes. The WL distance aims compares graphs with node features, has
  the same discriminative power as the classic Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism
  test and has deep connections to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Our interpretation
  connects the WL distance to the literature on distances for stochastic processes,
  which also makes the interpretation of the distance more accessible and intuitive.
  We further explore the connections between the WL distance and certain Message Passing
  Neural Networks, and discuss the implications of the WL distance for understanding
  the Lipschitz property and the universal approximation results for these networks.
