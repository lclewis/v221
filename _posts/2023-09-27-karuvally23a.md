title: 'Episodic Memory Theory of Recurrent Neural Networks: Insights into Long-Term
  Information Storage and Manipulation'
abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have emerged as powerful models capable
  of storing and manipulating external information over long periods in various domains.
  Yet, the mechanisms that underly this behavior remain a mystery due to the black-box
  nature of these models. This paper addresses this question by proposing an episodic
  memory theory of RNN dynamics, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the
  RNN weights as memories and inter-memory interactions. This approach sheds light
  on the inner workings of RNNs and connects to existing research on memory representation
  and organization. The theory extends the current linearization approaches by providing
  alternative interpretations of the eigenspectrum and its connection to the long-term
  storage and manipulation of information. We discuss how the segregation, representation,
  and composition of the variable binding problem—a fundamental question in cognitive
  science and artificial intelligence—can be mechanistically interpreted within the
  theory. Using an elementary task - repeat copy, we demonstrate the validity of the
  theory in experimental settings. Our work represents a step towards opening the
  black box of RNNs, offering new insights into their functionality and bridging the
  gap between recurrent neural networks and memory models.
