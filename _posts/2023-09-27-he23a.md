title: Product Manifold Learning with Independent Coordinate Selection
abstract: In many dimensionality reduction tasks, we wish to identify the constituent
  components that explain our observations. For manifold learning, this can be formalized
  as factoring a Riemannian product manifold. Recovering this factorization, however,
  may suffer from certain difficulties in practice, especially when data is sparse
  or noisy, or when one factor is distorted by the other. To address these limitations,
  we propose identifying non-redundant coordinates on the product manifold before
  applying product manifold learning to identify which coordinates correspond to different
  factor manifolds. We demonstrate our approach on both synthetic and real-world data.
