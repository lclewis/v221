title: 'Bridging Equational Properties and Patterns on Graphs: an AI-Based Approach'
abstract: AI-assisted solutions have recently proven successful when applied to Mathematics
  and have opened new possibilities for exploring unsolved problems that have eluded
  traditional approaches for years or even centuries. Following this direction, this
  paper presents an innovative approach aiming at establishing correlations between
  equational properties of algebraic structures that can be represented through graphs
  and specific sub-portions of their topological representation.  The methodology
  incorporates the utilization of graph neural architectures to validate theorems
  or conjectures, complemented by Explainability (XAI) metrics that lend support to
  these statements. In particular, we examine the distributive and modular properties
  of algebraic lattices, whose characterization is well-known in universal algebra,
  hence using these properties as an experimental test bench.  The findings of this
  study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying and
  retrieving established subpatterns that characterize the equational properties under
  investigation. Moreover, the approach exhibits the capability to generate novel
  and noteworthy candidates as theorem suggesters, thereby offering valuable prospects
  for further exploration by mathematicians.
