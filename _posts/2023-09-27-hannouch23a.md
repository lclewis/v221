title: Learning To See Topological Properties In 4D Using Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: Topology describes the essential structure of a space, and in 4D, a larger
  variety of topologically distinct manifolds can be embedded versus 2D or 3D. The
  present study investigates an end-to-end visual approach, which couples data generation
  software and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate the topology of 4D
  data. A synthetic 4D training data set is generated with the use of several manifolds,
  and then labelled with their associated Betti numbers by using techniques from algebraic
  topology. Several approaches to implementing a 4D convolution layer are compared.
  Experiments demonstrate that already a basic CNN can be trained to provide estimates
  for the Betti numbers associated with the number of one-, two-, and three-dimensional
  holes in the data. Some of the intricacies of topological data analysis in the 4D
  setting are also put on view, including aspects of persistent homology.
