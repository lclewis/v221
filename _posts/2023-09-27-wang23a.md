title: 'Homological Neural Networks: A Sparse Architecture for Multivariate Complexity'
abstract: 'The rapid progress of Artificial Intelligence research came with the development
  of increasingly complex deep learning models, leading to growing challenges in terms
  of computational complexity, energy efficiency and interpretability.  In this study,
  we apply advanced network-based information filtering techniques to design a novel
  deep neural network unit characterized by a sparse higher-order graphical architecture
  built over the homological structure of underlying data.  We demonstrate its effectiveness
  in two application domains which are traditionally challenging for deep learning:
  tabular data and time series regression problems. Results demonstrate the advantages
  of this novel design which can tie or overcome the results of state-of-the-art machine
  learning and deep learning models using only a fraction of parameters. '
