title: Geometrically Regularized Wasserstein Dictionary Learning
abstract: Wasserstein dictionary learning is an unsupervised approach to learning
  a collection of probability distributions that generate observed distributions as
  Wasserstein barycentric combinations. Existing methods solve an optimization problem
  that only seeks a dictionary and weights that minimize the reconstruction accuracy.
  However, there is no a priori reason to believe there are unique solutions in general
  to this problem. Moreover, the learned dictionary is, by design, optimized to represent
  the observed data set, and may not be useful for classification tasks or generative
  modeling. Just as regularization plays a key role in linear dictionary learning,
  we propose a geometric regularizer for Wasserstein space that promotes representations
  of a data distributions using nearby dictionary elements. We show that this regularizer
  leads to barycentric weights that concentrate on dictionary atoms local to each
  data distribution. When data are generated as Wasserstein barycenters of fixed distributions,
  this regularizer facilitates the recovery of the generating distributions in cases
  that are ill-posed for unregularized Wasserstein dictionary learning. Through experimentation
  on synthetic and real data, we show that our geometrically regularized approach
  yields more interpretable dictionaries in Wasserstein space which perform better
  in downstream applications.
