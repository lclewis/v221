title: Non-linear Embeddings in Hilbert Simplex Geometry
abstract: A key technique of machine learning and computer vision is to embed discrete
  weighted graphs into continuous spaces for further downstream analysis. Embedding
  discrete hierarchical structures in hyperbolic geometry has proven very successful
  since it was shown that any weighted tree can be embedded in that geometry with
  arbitrary low distortion. Various optimization methods for hyperbolic embeddings
  based on common  models of hyperbolic geometry have been studied. In this paper,
  we consider Hilbert geometry for the standard simplex which is isometric to a vector
  space equipped with the variation polytope norm. We study the representation power
  of this Hilbert simplex geometry by embedding distance matrices of graphs. Our findings
  demonstrate that Hilbert simplex geometry is competitive to alternative geometries
  such as the Poincar√© hyperbolic ball or the Euclidean geometry for embedding tasks
  while being fast and numerically robust.
