title: Learned Gridification for Efficient Point Cloud Processing
abstract: 'Neural operations that rely on neighborhood information are much more expensive
  when deployed on point clouds than on grid data due to the irregular distances between
  points in a point cloud. For example, in a convolution, the convolutional kernel
  must be recomputed for every point in a point cloud to consider the distances to
  all other points in its neighbourhood. In a grid, on the other hand, we can compute
  the kernel only once and reuse it for all query positions. As a result, operations
  that rely on neighborhood information scale much worse for point clouds than for
  grid data, specially for large inputs and large neighborhoods. In this work, we
  address the scalability issue of point cloud methods by tackling its root cause:
  the irregularity of the data. To this end, we propose learnable gridification as
  the first step in a point cloud processing pipeline to transform the point cloud
  into a compact, regular grid. Thanks to gridification, subsequent layers can use
  operations defined on regular grids, e.g., Conv3D, which scale much better than
  native point cloud methods. We then extend gridification to point cloud to point
  cloud tasks, e.g., segmentation, by adding a earnable de-gridification step at the
  end of the point cloud processing pipeline to map the compact, regular grid back
  to its original point cloud form. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we
  show that gridified networks scale better in terms of memory and time than networks
  directly applied on raw point cloud data, while being able to achieve competitive
  results.'
