title: Hyperbolic Sliced-Wasserstein via Geodesic and Horospherical Projections
abstract: Hyperbolic space embeddings have been shown beneficial for many learning
  tasks where data have an underlying hierarchical structure. Consequently, many machine
  learning tools were extended to such spaces, but only few discrepancies to compare
  probability distributions defined over those spaces exist. Among the possible candidates,
  optimal transport distances are well defined on such Riemannian manifolds and enjoy
  strong theoretical properties, but suffer from high computational cost. On Euclidean
  spaces,  sliced-Wasserstein distances, which leverage a closed-form solution of
  the Wasserstein distance in one dimension, are more computationally efficient, but
  are not readily available on hyperbolic spaces. In this work, we propose to derive
  novel hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein discrepancies. These constructions use projections
  on the underlying geodesics either along horospheres or geodesics. We study and
  compare them on different tasks where hyperbolic representations are relevant, such
  as sampling or image classification.
