title: Visualizing and Analyzing the Topology of Neuron Activations in Deep Adversarial
  Training
abstract: Deep models are known to be vulnerable to data adversarial attacks, and
  many adversarial training techniques have been developed to improve their adversarial
  robustness.  While data adversaries attack model predictions through modifying data,
  little is known about their impact on the neuron activations produced by the model,
  which play a crucial role in determining the modelâ€™s predictions and interpretability.  In
  this work, we aim to develop a topological understanding of adversarial training
  to enhance its interpretability.  We analyze the topological structure-in particular,
  mapper graphs-of neuron activations of data samples produced by deep adversarial
  training. Each node of a mapper graph represents a cluster of activations, and two
  nodes are connected by an edge if their corresponding clusters have a nonempty intersection.
  We provide an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates the utility of our
  topological framework in exploring the activation space.  We found that stronger
  attacks make the data samples more indistinguishable in the neuron activation space
  that leads to a lower accuracy.  Our tool also provides a natural way to identify
  the vulnerable data samples that may be useful in improving model robustness.
