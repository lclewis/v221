title: Equivariant Self-supervised Deep Pose Estimation for Cryo EM
abstract: Reconstructing the 3D volume of a molecule from its differently oriented
  2D projections is the central problem of cryo-EM, one of the main techniques for
  macro-molecule imaging.  Because the orientations are unknown, the estimation of
  the images’ poses is essential to solve this inverse problem. Typical methods either
  rely on *synchronization*, which leverages the estimated relative poses of the images
  to constrain their absolute ones, or *jointly estimate* the poses and the 3D density
  of the molecule in an iterative fashion. Unfortunately, synchronization methods
  don’t account for the complete images’ generative process and, therefore, achieve
  lower noise robustness. In the second case, the iterative joint optimization suffers
  from convergence issues and a higher computational cost, due to the 3D reconstruction
  steps. In this work, we directly estimate individual poses with equivariant deep
  graph networks trained using a self-supervised loss, which enforces agreement in
  Fourier domain of images pairs along the *common lines* defined by their poses.
  In particular, the *equivariant* design turns out essential for the proper convergence.
  As a result, our method can leverage the synchronization constraints - encoded by
  the synchronization graph structure - to improve convergence as well as the images
  generative process - via the common lines loss -, with no need to perform intermediate
  reconstructions.
