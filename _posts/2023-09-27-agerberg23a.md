title: Global and Relative Topological Features from Homological Invariants of Subsampled
  Datasets
abstract: Homology-based invariants can be used to characterize the geometry of datasets
  and thereby gain some understanding of the processes generating those datasets.
  In this work we investigate how the geometry of a dataset changes when it is subsampled
  in various ways. In our framework the dataset serves as a reference object; we then
  consider different points in the ambient space and endow them with a geometry defined
  in relation to the reference object, for instance by subsampling the dataset proportionally
  to the distance between its elements and the point under consideration. We illustrate
  how this process can be used to extract rich geometrical information, allowing for
  example to classify points coming from different data distributions.
