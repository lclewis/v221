title: Topological Feature Selection
abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised, graph-based filter feature
  selection technique which exploits the power of topologically constrained network
  representations. We model dependency structures among features using a family of
  chordal graphs (i.e. the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph), and we maximise
  the likelihood of featuresâ€™ relevance by studying their relative position inside
  the network. Such an approach presents three aspects that are particularly satisfactory
  compared to its alternatives: (i) it is highly tunable and easily adaptable to the
  nature of input data; (ii) it is fully explainable, maintaining, at the same time,
  a remarkable level of simplicity; (iii) it is computationally cheap. We test our
  algorithm on $16$ benchmark datasets from different application domains showing
  that it  outperforms or matches the current state-of-the-art under heterogeneous
  evaluation conditions.'
