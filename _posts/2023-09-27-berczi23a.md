title: An ML approach to resolution of singularities
abstract: 'The solution set of a system of polynomial equations typically contains
  ill-behaved, singular points. Resolution is a fundamental process in geometry in
  which we replace singular points with smooth points, while keeping the rest of the
  solution set unchanged. Resolutions are not unique: the usual way to describe them
  involves repeatedly performing a fundamental operation known as "blowing-up", and
  the complexity of the resolution highly depends on certain choices.  The process
  can be translated into various versions of a 2-player game, the so-called Hironaka
  game, and a winning strategy for the first  player provides a solution to the resolution
  problem. In this paper we introduce a new approach to the Hironaka game that uses
  reinforcement learning agents to find optimal resolutions of singularities. In certain
  domains, the trained model outperforms state-of-the-art selection heuristics in
  total number of polynomial additions performed, which provides a proof-of-concept
  that recent developments in machine learning have the potential to improve performance
  of algorithms in symbolic computation.'
