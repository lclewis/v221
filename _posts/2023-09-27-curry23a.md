title: Topologically Attributed Graphs for Shape Discrimination
abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel family of attributed graphs for the purpose
  of shape discrimination. Our graphs typically arise from variations on the Mapper
  graph construction, which is an  an approximation of the Reeb graph for point cloud
  data. Our attributions enrich these constructions with (persistent) homology in
  ways that are provably stable, thereby recording extra topological information that
  is typically lost in these graph constructions. We provide experiments which illustrate
  the use of these invariants for shape representation and classification. In particular,
  we obtain competitive shape classification results when using our topologically
  attributed graphs as inputs to a simple graph neural network classifier.
