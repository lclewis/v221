title: An Exact Kernel Equivalence for Finite Classification Models
abstract: We explore the equivalence between neural networks and kernel methods by
  deriving the first exact representation of any finite-size parametric classification
  model trained with gradient descent as a kernel machine. We compare our exact representation
  to the well-known Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and discuss approximation error relative
  to the NTK and other non-exact path kernel formulations. We experimentally demonstrate
  that the kernel can be computed for realistic networks up to machine precision.
  We use this exact kernel to show that our theoretical contribution can provide useful
  insights into the predictions made by neural networks, particularly the way in which
  they generalize.
