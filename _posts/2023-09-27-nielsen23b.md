title: Fisher-Rao and pullback Hilbert cone distances on the multivariate Gaussian
  manifold with applications  to simplification and quantization of mixtures
abstract: Data sets of multivariate normal distributions abound in many scientific
  areas like  diffusion tensor medical imaging, structure tensor computer vision,
  radar signal processing, machine learning, etc. In order to process those data sets
  for downstream tasks like filtering, classification or clustering, one needs to
  define proper notions of dissimilarities and paths joining normal distributions.  The
  Fisher-Rao distance defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher
  information is such a principled distance which however is not known in closed-form
  excepts on a few particular cases. We first report a fast and robust method to approximate
  arbitrarily finely the Fisher-Rao distance between normal distributions. Second,
  we introduce a distance based on a diffeomorphic embedding of the Gaussian manifold
  into a submanifold of the higher-dimensional symmetric positive-definite cone.  We
  show that the projective Hilbert distance on the cone is a metric on the embedded
  Gaussian submanifold and pullback that distance with the straight line Hilbert cone
  geodesics to obtain a distance and paths between normal distributions. Compared
  to the Fisher-Rao distance approximation, the pullback Hilbert cone distance is
  computationally light since it requires to compute only extreme eigenvalues of matrices.
  Finally, we show how to use those distances in clustering tasks.
