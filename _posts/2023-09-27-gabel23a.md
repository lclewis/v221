title: Learning Lie Group Symmetry Transformations with Neural Networks
abstract: The problem of detecting and quantifying the presence of symmetries in datasets
  is useful for model selection, generative modeling, and data analysis, amongst others.
  While existing methods for hard-coding transformations in neural networks require
  prior knowledge of the symmetries of the task at hand, this work focuses on discovering
  and characterising unknown symmetries present in the dataset, namely, Lie group
  symmetry transformations beyond the traditional ones usually considered in the field
  (rotation, scaling, and translation). Specifically, we consider a scenario in which
  a dataset has been transformed by a one-parameter subgroup of transformations with
  different parameter values for each data point. Our goal is to characterise the
  transformation group and the distribution of the parameter values, even when they
  aren’t small or the transformation group isn’t one of the traditional ones. The
  results showcase the effectiveness of the approach in both these settings.
