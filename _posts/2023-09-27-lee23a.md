title: 'On Explicit Curvature Regularization in Deep Generative Models '
abstract: We propose a family of curvature-based regularization terms for deep generative
  model learning. Explicit coordinate-invariant formulas for both intrinsic and extrinsic
  curvature measures are derived for the case of arbitrary data manifolds embedded
  in higher-dimensional Euclidean space. Because computing the curvature is a highly
  computation-intensive process involving the evaluation of second-order derivatives,
  efficient formulas are derived for approximately evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic
  curvatures. Comparative studies are conducted that compare the relative efficacy
  of intrinsic versus extrinsic curvature-based regularization measures, as well as
  performance comparisons against existing autoencoder training methods. Experiments
  involving noisy motion capture data confirm that curvature-based methods outperform
  existing autoencoder regularization methods, with intrinsic curvature measures slightly
  more effective than extrinsic curvature measures.
