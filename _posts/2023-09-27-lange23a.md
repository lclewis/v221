title: Deep Networks as Paths on the Manifold of Neural Representations
abstract: '    Deep neural networks implement a sequence of layer-by-layer operations
  that are each relatively easy to understand, but the resulting overall computation
  is generally difficult to understand. An intuitive hypothesis is that the role of
  each layer is to reformat information to reduce the "distance" to the desired outputs.
  With this spatial analogy, the layer-wise computation implemented by a deep neural
  network can be viewed as a path along a high-dimensional manifold of neural representations.
  With this framework, each hidden layer transforms its inputs by taking a step of
  a particular size and direction along the manifold, ideally moving towards the desired
  network outputs. We formalize this intuitive idea by leveraging recent advances
  in _metric_ representational similarity. We extend existing representational distance
  methods by defining and characterizing the _manifold_ that neural representations
  live on, allowing us to calculate quantities like the shortest path or tangent direction
  separating representations between hidden layers of a network or across different
  networks. We then demonstrate these tools by visualizing and comparing the paths
  taken by a collection of trained neural networks with a variety of architectures,
  finding systematic relationships between model depth and width, and properties of
  their paths. '
