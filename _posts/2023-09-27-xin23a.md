title: 'GRIL: A $2$-parameter Persistence Based Vectorization for Machine Learning'
abstract: "$1$-parameter persistent homology, a cornerstone in Topological Data Analysis
  (TDA), studies the evolution of topological features such as connected components
  and cycles hidden in data. It has been applied to enhance the representation power
  of deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To enrich the representations
  of topological features,  here we propose to study $2$-parameter persistence modules
  induced by bi-filtration functions.  In order to incorporate these representations
  into machine learning models, we introduce a novel vector representation called
  Generalized Rank Invariant Landscape (GRIL) for $2$-parameter persistence modules.
  \ We show that this vector representation is $1$-Lipschitz stable and differentiable
  with respect to underlying filtration functions and can be easily integrated into
  machine learning models to augment encoding topological features. We present an
  algorithm to compute the vector representation  efficiently. We also test our methods
  on synthetic and benchmark graph datasets, and compare the results with previous
  vector representations of $1$-parameter and $2$-parameter persistence modules. Further,
  we augment GNNs with GRIL features and observe an increase in performance indicating
  that GRIL can capture additional features enriching GNNs.  We make the complete
  code for the proposed method available at [https://github.com/soham0209/mpml-graph](https://github.com/soham0209/mpml-graph)."
