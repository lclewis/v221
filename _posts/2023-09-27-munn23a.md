title: A margin-based multiclass generalization bound via geometric complexity
abstract: There has been considerable effort to better understand the generalization
  capabilities of deep neural networks both as a means to unlock a theoretical understanding
  of their success as well as providing directions for further improvements. In this
  paper we investigate margin-based multiclass generalization bounds for neural networks
  which rely on a recent complexity measure, the geometric complexity,  developed
  for neural networks and which measures the variability of the model function. We
  derive a new upper bound on the generalization error which scale with the margin-normalized
  geometric complexity of the network and which hold for a broad family of data distributions
  and model classes. Our generalization bound is empirically investigated for a ResNet-18
  model trained with SGD on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with both original
  and random labels.
