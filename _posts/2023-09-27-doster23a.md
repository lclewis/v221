title: Preface
abstract: The 2nd ICML Workshop on Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Machine Learning
  is an exercise in bringing together researchers working in both of the above threads
  to exchange ideas, present recent work, and form new collaborations. This proceedings
  collection captures some of the rich flow of ideas that happened in the workshop.
  It is also a testament to the breadth of ways that mathematics is currently being
  applied to modern ML, from the topology of models and datasets to equivariance of
  models to group actions to applications of hyperbolic geometry to learning problems.
