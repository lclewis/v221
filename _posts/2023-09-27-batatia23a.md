title: A Geometric Insight into Equivariant Message Passing Neural Networks on Riemannian
  Manifolds
abstract: This work proposes a geometric insight into equivariant message passing
  on Riemannian manifolds. As previously proposed, numerical features on Riemannian
  manifolds are represented as coordinate-independent feature fields on the manifold.
  To any coordinate-independent feature field on a manifold comes attached an equivariant
  embedding of the principal bundle to the space of numerical features. We argue that
  the metric this embedding induces on the numerical feature space should optimally
  preserve the principal bundleâ€™s original metric. This optimality criterion leads
  to the minimization of a twisted form of the Polyakov action with respect to the
  graph of this embedding, yielding an equivariant diffusion process on the associated
  vector bundle. We obtain a message passing scheme on the manifold by discretizing
  the diffusion equation flow for a fixed time step. We propose a higher- order equivariant
  diffusion process equivalent to diffusion on the cartesian product of the base manifold.
  The discretization of the higher-order diffusion process on a graph yields a new
  general class of equivariant GNN, generalizing the ACE and MACE formalism to data
  on Riemannian manifolds.
