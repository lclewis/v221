title: 'FAM: Relative Flatness Aware Minimization'
abstract: Flatness of the loss curve around a model at hand has been shown to empirically
  correlate with its generalization ability. Optimizing for flatness has been proposed
  as early as 1994 by Hochreiter and Schmidthuber, and was followed by more recent
  successful sharpness-aware optimization techniques. Their widespread adoption in
  practice, though, is dubious because of the lack of theoretically grounded connection
  between flatness and generalization, in particular in light of the reparameterization
  curseâ€”certain reparameterizations of a neural network change most flatness measures
  but do not change generalization. Recent theoretical work suggests that a particular
  relative flatness measure can be connected to generalization and solves the reparameterization
  curse. In this paper, we derive a regularizer based on this relative flatness that
  is easy to compute, fast, efficient, and works with arbitrary loss functions. It
  requires computing the Hessian only of a single layer of the network, which makes
  it applicable to large neural networks, and with it avoids an expensive mapping
  of the loss surface in the vicinity of the model. In an extensive empirical evaluation
  we show that this relative flatness aware minimization (FAM) improves generalization
  in a multitude of applications and models, both in finetuning and standard training.
  We make the code available at github.
