title = {Learned Gridification for Efficient Point Cloud Processing},
author = {{v}an {d}er {L}inden, Putri A and Romero, David W. and Bekkers, Erik J},
pages = {9-20},
abstract = {Neural operations that rely on neighborhood information are much more expensive when deployed on point clouds than on grid data due to the irregular distances between points in a point cloud. For example, in a convolution, the convolutional kernel must be recomputed for every point in a point cloud to consider the distances to all other points in its neighbourhood. In a grid, on the other hand, we can compute the kernel only once and reuse it for all query positions. As a result, operations that rely on neighborhood information scale much worse for point clouds than for grid data, specially for large inputs and large neighborhoods.
In this work, we address the scalability issue of point cloud methods by tackling its root cause: the irregularity of the data. To this end, we propose learnable gridification as the first step in a point cloud processing pipeline to transform the point cloud into a compact, regular grid. Thanks to gridification, subsequent layers can use operations defined on regular grids, e.g., Conv3D, which scale much better than native point cloud methods. We then extend gridification to point cloud to point cloud tasks, e.g., segmentation, by adding a earnable de-gridification step at the end of the point cloud processing pipeline to map the compact, regular grid back to its original point cloud form. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that gridified networks scale better in terms of memory and time than networks directly applied on raw point cloud data, while being able to achieve competitive results.},

pages = {21-36},
abstract = {Reconstructing the 3D volume of a molecule from its differently oriented 2D projections is the central problem of cryo-EM, one of the main techniques for macro-molecule imaging. 
Because the orientations are unknown, the estimation of the images' poses is essential to solve this inverse problem.
Typical methods either rely on *synchronization*, which leverages the estimated relative poses of the images to constrain their absolute ones, or *jointly estimate* the poses and the 3D density of the molecule in an iterative fashion.
Unfortunately, synchronization methods don't account for the complete images' generative process and, therefore, achieve lower noise robustness.
In the second case, the iterative joint optimization suffers from convergence issues and a higher computational cost, due to the 3D reconstruction steps.
In this work, we directly estimate individual poses with equivariant deep graph networks trained using a self-supervised loss, which enforces agreement in Fourier domain of images pairs along the *common lines* defined by their poses.
In particular, the *equivariant* design turns out essential for the proper convergence.
As a result, our method can leverage the synchronization constraints - encoded by the synchronization graph structure - to improve convergence as well as the images generative process - via the common lines loss -, with no need to perform intermediate reconstructions.},

pages = {37-49},
abstract = {Flatness of the loss curve around a model at hand has been shown to empirically correlate with its generalization ability. Optimizing for flatness has been proposed as early as 1994 by Hochreiter and Schmidthuber, and was followed by more recent successful sharpness-aware optimization techniques. Their widespread adoption in practice, though, is dubious because of the lack of theoretically grounded connection between flatness and generalization, in particular in light of the reparameterization curseâ€”certain reparameterizations of a neural network change most flatness measures but do not change generalization. Recent theoretical work suggests that a particular relative flatness measure can be connected to generalization and solves the reparameterization curse. In this paper, we derive a regularizer based on this relative flatness that is easy to compute, fast, efficient, and works with arbitrary loss functions. It requires computing the Hessian only of a single layer of the network, which makes it applicable to large neural networks, and with it avoids an expensive mapping of the loss surface in the vicinity of the model. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that this relative flatness aware minimization (FAM) improves generalization in a multitude of applications and models, both in finetuning and standard training. We make the code available at github.},

Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a dataset has been transformed by a one-parameter subgroup of transformations with different parameter values for each data point. Our goal is to characterise the transformation group and the distribution of the parameter values, even when they aren't small or the transformation group isn't one of the traditional ones. The results showcase the effectiveness of the approach in both these settings.},

author = {Laenen, Steinar},
pages = {60-71},
abstract = {Neural network pruning has gained significant attention for its potential to reduce computational resources required for training and inference. A large body of research has shown that networks can be pruned both after training and at initialisation, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to dense networks. However, current methods rely on iteratively pruning or repairing the network to avoid over-pruning and layer collapse. Recent work has found that by treating neural networks as a sequence of bipartite graphs, pruning can be studied through the lens of spectral graph theory. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel pruning approach using spectral sparsification, which aims to preserve meaningful properties of a dense graph with a sparse subgraph, by preserving the spectrum of the dense graph's adjacency matrix. We empirically validate and investigate our method, and show that one-shot pruning using spectral sparsification preserves performance at higher levels of sparsity compared to its one-shot counterparts. Additionally, we theoretically analyse our method with respect to local and global connectivity.},

However, besides the impressive performance, the quadratic time and space complexity of Transformers with respect to sequence length pose significant limitations for handling long sequences. While efficient Transformer architectures like Linformer and Performer with linear complexity have emerged as promising solutions, their theoretical understanding remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Sumformer, a novel and simple architecture capable of universally approximating equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions. We use Sumformer to give the first universal approximation results for Linformer and Performer. Moreover, we derive a new proof for Transformers, showing that just one attention layer is sufficient for universal approximation.},

Our attributions enrich these constructions with (persistent) homology in ways that are provably stable, thereby recording extra topological information that is typically lost in these graph constructions. We provide experiments which illustrate the use of these invariants for shape representation and classification. In particular, we obtain competitive shape classification results when using our topologically attributed graphs as inputs to a simple graph neural network classifier.},

pages = {102-133},
abstract = {    Deep neural networks implement a sequence of layer-by-layer operations that are each relatively easy to understand, but the resulting overall computation is generally difficult to understand. An intuitive hypothesis is that the role of each layer is to reformat information to reduce the "distance" to the desired outputs. With this spatial analogy, the layer-wise computation implemented by a deep neural network can be viewed as a path along a high-dimensional manifold of neural representations. With this framework, each hidden layer transforms its inputs by taking a step of a particular size and direction along the manifold, ideally moving towards the desired network outputs. We formalize this intuitive idea by leveraging recent advances in _metric_ representational similarity. We extend existing representational distance methods by defining and characterizing the _manifold_ that neural representations live on, allowing us to calculate quantities like the shortest path or tangent direction separating representations between hidden layers of a network or across different networks. We then demonstrate these tools by visualizing and comparing the paths taken by a collection of trained neural networks with a variety of architectures, finding systematic relationships between model depth and width, and properties of their paths.

pages = {134-145},
abstract = {Deep models are known to be vulnerable to data adversarial attacks, and many adversarial training techniques have been developed to improve their adversarial robustness. 
While data adversaries attack model predictions through modifying data, little is known about their impact on the neuron activations produced by the model, which play a crucial role in determining the model's predictions and interpretability. 
In this work, we aim to develop a topological understanding of adversarial training to enhance its interpretability. 
We analyze the topological structure-in particular, mapper graphs-of neuron activations of data samples produced by deep adversarial training.
Each node of a mapper graph represents a cluster of activations, and two nodes are connected by an edge if their corresponding clusters have a nonempty intersection.
We provide an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates the utility of our topological framework in exploring the activation space. 
We found that stronger attacks make the data samples more indistinguishable in the neuron activation space that leads to a lower accuracy. 
Our tool also provides a natural way to identify the vulnerable data samples that may be useful in improving model robustness.},

Our ILS method approximates the behavior of a black-box graph model by fitting a simple surrogate model in the local neighborhood of a given input example. Leveraging the interpretability of the surrogate, ILS is able to identify the most relevant nodes contributing to a specific prediction. To efficiently identify these nodes, we utilize group sparse linear models as local surrogates. Through empirical evaluations on explainability benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph explainability methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in providing enhanced interpretability for GNN predictions.},

The methodology incorporates the utilization of graph neural architectures to validate theorems or conjectures, complemented by Explainability (XAI) metrics that lend support to these statements.
In particular, we examine the distributive and modular properties of algebraic lattices, whose characterization is well-known in universal algebra, hence using these properties as an experimental test bench.

abstract = {Unsupervised learning has recently significantly gained in popularity, especially with deep learning-based approaches. Despite numerous successes and approaching supervised-level performance on a variety of academic benchmarks, it is still hard to train and evaluate SSL models in practice due to the unsupervised nature of the problem. Even with networks trained in a supervised fashion, it is often unclear whether they will perform well when transferred to another domain.

Past works are generally limited to assessing the amount of information contained in embeddings, which is most relevant for self-supervised learning of deep neural networks. This works chooses to follow a different approach: can we quantify how easy it is to linearly separate the data in a stable way? We survey the literature and uncover three methods that could be potentially used for evaluating quality of representations. We also introduce one novel method based on recent advances in understanding the high-dimensional geometric structure self-supervised learning.

We conduct extensive experiments and study the properties of these metrics and ones introduced in the previous work. Our results suggest that while there is no free lunch, there are metrics that can robustly estimate embedding quality in an unsupervised way.},

pages = {218-227},
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate properties and limitations of invariance learned by neural networks from the data compared to the genuine invariance achieved through invariant weight-tying. To do so, we adopt a group theoretical perspective and analyze invariance learning in neural networks without weight-tying constraints. We demonstrate that even when a network learns to correctly classify samples on a group orbit, the underlying decision-making in such a model does not attain genuine invariance. Instead, learned invariance is strongly conditioned on the input data, rendering it unreliable if the input distribution shifts. We next demonstrate how to guide invariance learning toward genuine invariance by regularizing the invariance of a model at the training. To this end, we propose several metrics to quantify learned invariance: (i) predictive distribution invariance, (ii) logit invariance, and (iii) saliency invariance similarity. We show that the invariance learned with the invariance error regularization closely reassembles the genuine invariance of weight-tying models and reliably holds even under a severe input distribution shift. Closer analysis of the learned invariance also reveals the spectral decay phenomenon, when a network chooses to achieve the invariance to a specific transformation group by reducing the sensitivity to any input perturbation.},

abstract = {The most prevalent class of neural networks operating on graphs are message passing neural networks (MPNNs), in which the representation of a node is updated iteratively by aggregating information in the 1-hop neighborhood. Since this paradigm for computing node embeddings may prevent the model from learning coarse topological structures, the initial features are often augmented with structural information of the graph, typically in the form of Laplacian eigenvectors or Random Walk transition probabilities. In this work, we explore the contribution of message passing when strong structural encodings are provided. We introduce a novel way of modeling the interaction between feature and structural information based on their tensor product rather than the standard concatenation. The choice of interaction is compared in common scenarios and in settings where the capacity of the message-passing layer is severely reduced and ultimately the message-passing phase is removed altogether. Our results indicate that using tensor-based encodings is always at least on par with the concatenation-based encoding and that it makes the model much more robust when the message passing layers are removed, on some tasks incurring almost no drop in performance. This suggests that the importance of message passing is limited when the model can construct strong structural encodings.},

We present an algorithm to compute the vector representation  efficiently. We also test our methods on synthetic and benchmark graph datasets, and compare the results with previous vector representations of $1$-parameter and $2$-parameter persistence modules. Further, we augment GNNs with GRIL features and observe an increase in performance indicating that GRIL can capture additional features enriching GNNs.

This approach sheds light on the inner workings of RNNs and connects to existing research on memory representation and organization. The theory extends the current linearization approaches by providing alternative interpretations of the eigenspectrum and its connection to the long-term storage and manipulation of information. We discuss how the segregation, representation, and composition of the variable binding problemâ€”a fundamental question in cognitive science and artificial intelligenceâ€”can be mechanistically interpreted within the theory. Using an elementary task - repeat copy, we demonstrate the validity of the theory in experimental settings. Our work represents a step towards opening the black box of RNNs, offering new insights into their functionality and bridging the gap between recurrent neural networks and memory models.},

title = {Geometrically Regularized Wasserstein Dictionary Learning},
author = {Mueller, Marshall and Aeron, Shuchin and Murphy, James M. and Tasissa, Abiy},
pages = {384-403},
abstract = {Wasserstein dictionary learning is an unsupervised approach to learning a collection of probability distributions that generate observed distributions as Wasserstein barycentric combinations. Existing methods solve an optimization problem that only seeks a dictionary and weights that minimize the reconstruction accuracy. However, there is no a priori reason to believe there are unique solutions in general to this problem. Moreover, the learned dictionary is, by design, optimized to represent the observed data set, and may not be useful for classification tasks or generative modeling. Just as regularization plays a key role in linear dictionary learning, we propose a geometric regularizer for Wasserstein space that promotes representations of a data distributions using nearby dictionary elements. We show that this regularizer leads to barycentric weights that concentrate on dictionary atoms local to each data distribution. When data are generated as Wasserstein barycenters of fixed distributions, this regularizer facilitates the recovery of the generating distributions in cases that are ill-posed for unregularized Wasserstein dictionary learning. Through experimentation on synthetic and real data, we show that our geometrically regularized approach yields more interpretable dictionaries in Wasserstein space which perform better in downstream applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel interpretation of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) distance introduced by \cite{chen2022weisfeilerlehman} using concepts from stochastic processes. The WL distance aims compares graphs with node features, has the same discriminative power as the classic Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test and has deep connections to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Our interpretation connects the WL distance to the literature on distances for stochastic processes, which also makes the interpretation of the distance more accessible and intuitive. We further explore the connections between the WL distance and certain Message Passing Neural Networks, and discuss the implications of the WL distance for understanding the Lipschitz property and the universal approximation results for these networks.},

pages = {426-436},
abstract = {This work proposes a geometric insight into
equivariant message passing on Riemannian
manifolds. As previously proposed, numerical
features on Riemannian manifolds are represented
as coordinate-independent feature fields on the
manifold. To any coordinate-independent feature
field on a manifold comes attached an equivariant
embedding of the principal bundle to the space
of numerical features. We argue that the metric
this embedding induces on the numerical feature
space should optimally preserve the principal
bundle's original metric. This optimality criterion
leads to the minimization of a twisted form
of the Polyakov action with respect to the
graph of this embedding, yielding an equivariant
diffusion process on the associated vector bundle.
We obtain a message passing scheme on the
manifold by discretizing the diffusion equation
flow for a fixed time step. We propose a higher-
order equivariant diffusion process equivalent to
diffusion on the cartesian product of the base
manifold. The discretization of the higher-order
diffusion process on a graph yields a new general
class of equivariant GNN, generalizing the ACE
and MACE formalism to data on Riemannian
manifolds.},

The present study investigates an end-to-end visual approach, which couples data generation software and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate the topology of 4D data. A synthetic 4D training data set is generated with the use of several manifolds, and then labelled with their associated Betti numbers by using techniques from algebraic topology. Several approaches to implementing a 4D convolution layer are compared. Experiments demonstrate that already a basic CNN can be trained to provide estimates for the Betti numbers associated with the number of one-, two-, and three-dimensional holes in the data. Some of the intricacies of topological data analysis in the 4D setting are also put on view, including aspects of persistent homology.},

This property holds for a wide range of networks trained for a wide range of purposes that have nothing to do with this topological application.

author = {Berczi, Gergely and Fan, Honglu and Zeng, Mingcong},
pages = {469-487},
abstract = {The solution set of a system of polynomial equations typically contains ill-behaved, singular points. Resolution is a fundamental process in geometry in which we replace singular points with smooth points, while keeping the rest of the solution set unchanged. Resolutions are not unique: the usual way to describe them involves repeatedly performing a fundamental operation known as "blowing-up", and the complexity of the resolution highly depends on certain choices.  The process can be translated into various versions of a 2-player game, the so-called Hironaka game, and a winning strategy for the first  player provides a solution to the resolution problem. In this paper we introduce a new approach to the Hironaka game that uses reinforcement learning agents to find optimal resolutions of singularities.
In certain domains, the trained model outperforms state-of-the-art selection heuristics in total number of polynomial additions performed, which provides a proof-of-concept that recent developments in machine learning have the potential to improve performance of algorithms in symbolic computation.},

author = {Nielsen, Frank},
pages = {488-504},
abstract = {Data sets of multivariate normal distributions abound in many scientific areas like  diffusion tensor medical imaging, structure tensor computer vision, radar signal processing, machine learning, etc.
In order to process those data sets for downstream tasks like filtering, classification or clustering, one needs to define proper notions of dissimilarities and paths joining normal distributions. 
The Fisher-Rao distance defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information is such a principled distance which however is not known in closed-form excepts on a few particular cases.
We first report a fast and robust method to approximate arbitrarily finely the Fisher-Rao distance between normal distributions.
Second, we introduce a distance based on a diffeomorphic embedding of the Gaussian manifold into a submanifold of the higher-dimensional symmetric positive-definite cone. 
We show that the projective Hilbert distance on the cone is a metric on the embedded Gaussian submanifold and pullback that distance with the straight line Hilbert cone geodesics to obtain a distance and paths between normal distributions.
Compared to the Fisher-Rao distance approximation, the pullback Hilbert cone distance is computationally light since it requires to compute only extreme eigenvalues of matrices.
Finally, we show how to use those distances in clustering tasks.},

Explicit coordinate-invariant formulas for both intrinsic and extrinsic curvature measures are derived for the case of arbitrary data manifolds embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean space. Because computing the curvature is a highly computation-intensive process involving the evaluation of second-order derivatives, efficient formulas are derived for approximately evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures. Comparative studies are conducted that compare the relative efficacy of intrinsic versus extrinsic curvature-based regularization measures, as well as performance comparisons against existing autoencoder training methods. Experiments involving noisy motion capture data confirm that curvature-based methods outperform existing autoencoder regularization methods, with intrinsic curvature measures slightly more effective than extrinsic curvature measures.},

We present the framework MASIL as a step towards learning the maximal separable classifier. It addresses the common problem i.e forgetting of old classes and over-fitting to novel classes by learning the classifier weights to be maximally separable between classes forming a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame. We propose the idea of concept factorization explaining the collapsed features for base session classes in terms of concept basis and use these to induce classifier simplex for few shot classes. We further adds fine tuning to reduce any error occurred during factorization and train the classifier jointly on base and novel classes without retaining any base class samples in memory. Experimental results on miniImageNet, CIFAR-100 and CUB-200 demonstrate that MASIL outperforms all the benchmarks.},

Such an approach presents three aspects that are particularly satisfactory compared to its alternatives: (i) it is highly tunable and easily adaptable to the nature of input data; (ii) it is fully explainable, maintaining, at the same time, a remarkable level of simplicity; (iii) it is computationally cheap.

abstract = {In this paper, we study linear regression applied to data structured on a manifold. We assume that the data manifold is smooth and is embedded in a Euclidean space, and our objective is to reveal the impact of the data manifold's extrinsic geometry on the regression. Specifically, we analyze the impact of the manifold's curvatures (or higher order nonlinearity in the parameterization when the curvatures are locally zero) on the uniqueness of the regression solution. Our findings suggest that the corresponding linear regression does not have a unique solution when the manifold is flat. Otherwise, the manifold's curvature (or higher order nonlinearity in the embedding) may contribute significantly, particularly in the solution associated with the normal directions of the manifold. Our findings thus reveal the role of data manifold geometry in ensuring the stability of regression models for out-of-distribution inferences.},
